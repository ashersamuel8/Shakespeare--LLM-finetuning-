"2","Henry IV",,,,"SCENE I. London. The palace."
"3","Henry IV",,,,"Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others"
"4","Henry IV","1","1.1.1","KING HENRY IV","So shaken as we are, so wan with care,"
"5","Henry IV","1","1.1.2","KING HENRY IV","Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,"
"6","Henry IV","1","1.1.3","KING HENRY IV","And breathe short-winded accents of new broils"
"7","Henry IV","1","1.1.4","KING HENRY IV","To be commenced in strands afar remote."
"8","Henry IV","1","1.1.5","KING HENRY IV","No more the thirsty entrance of this soil"
"9","Henry IV","1","1.1.6","KING HENRY IV","Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood,"
"10","Henry IV","1","1.1.7","KING HENRY IV","Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,"
"11","Henry IV","1","1.1.8","KING HENRY IV","Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs"
"12","Henry IV","1","1.1.9","KING HENRY IV","Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,"
"13","Henry IV","1","1.1.10","KING HENRY IV","Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,"
"14","Henry IV","1","1.1.11","KING HENRY IV","All of one nature, of one substance bred,"
"15","Henry IV","1","1.1.12","KING HENRY IV","Did lately meet in the intestine shock"
"16","Henry IV","1","1.1.13","KING HENRY IV","And furious close of civil butchery"
"17","Henry IV","1","1.1.14","KING HENRY IV","Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,"
"18","Henry IV","1","1.1.15","KING HENRY IV","March all one way and be no more opposed"
"19","Henry IV","1","1.1.16","KING HENRY IV","Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:"
"20","Henry IV","1","1.1.17","KING HENRY IV","The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,"
"21","Henry IV","1","1.1.18","KING HENRY IV","No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,"
"22","Henry IV","1","1.1.19","KING HENRY IV","As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,"
"23","Henry IV","1","1.1.20","KING HENRY IV","Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross"
"24","Henry IV","1","1.1.21","KING HENRY IV","We are impressed and engaged to fight,"
"25","Henry IV","1","1.1.22","KING HENRY IV","Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,"
"26","Henry IV","1","1.1.23","KING HENRY IV","Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb"
"27","Henry IV","1","1.1.24","KING HENRY IV","To chase these pagans in those holy fields"
"28","Henry IV","1","1.1.25","KING HENRY IV","Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet"
"29","Henry IV","1","1.1.26","KING HENRY IV","Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd"
"30","Henry IV","1","1.1.27","KING HENRY IV","For our advantage on the bitter cross."
"31","Henry IV","1","1.1.28","KING HENRY IV","But this our purpose now is twelve month old,"
"32","Henry IV","1","1.1.29","KING HENRY IV","And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:"
"33","Henry IV","1","1.1.30","KING HENRY IV","Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear"
"34","Henry IV","1","1.1.31","KING HENRY IV","Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,"
"35","Henry IV","1","1.1.32","KING HENRY IV","What yesternight our council did decree"
"36","Henry IV","1","1.1.33","KING HENRY IV","In forwarding this dear expedience."
"37","Henry IV","2","1.1.34","WESTMORELAND","My liege, this haste was hot in question,"
"38","Henry IV","2","1.1.35","WESTMORELAND","And many limits of the charge set down"
"39","Henry IV","2","1.1.36","WESTMORELAND","But yesternight: when all athwart there came"
"40","Henry IV","2","1.1.37","WESTMORELAND","A post from Wales loaden with heavy news,"
"41","Henry IV","2","1.1.38","WESTMORELAND","Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,"
"42","Henry IV","2","1.1.39","WESTMORELAND","Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight"
"43","Henry IV","2","1.1.40","WESTMORELAND","Against the irregular and wild Glendower,"
"44","Henry IV","2","1.1.41","WESTMORELAND","Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,"
"45","Henry IV","2","1.1.42","WESTMORELAND","A thousand of his people butchered,"
"46","Henry IV","2","1.1.43","WESTMORELAND","Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,"
"47","Henry IV","2","1.1.44","WESTMORELAND","Such beastly shameless transformation,"
"48","Henry IV","2","1.1.45","WESTMORELAND","By those Welshwomen done as may not be"
"49","Henry IV","2","1.1.46","WESTMORELAND","Without much shame retold or spoken of."
"50","Henry IV","3","1.1.47","KING HENRY IV","It seems then that the tidings of this broil"
"51","Henry IV","3","1.1.48","KING HENRY IV","Brake off our business for the Holy Land."
"52","Henry IV","4","1.1.49","WESTMORELAND","This match'd with other did, my gracious lord,"
"53","Henry IV","4","1.1.50","WESTMORELAND","For more uneven and unwelcome news"
"54","Henry IV","4","1.1.51","WESTMORELAND","Came from the north and thus it did import:"
"55","Henry IV","4","1.1.52","WESTMORELAND","On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,"
"56","Henry IV","4","1.1.53","WESTMORELAND","Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,"
"57","Henry IV","4","1.1.54","WESTMORELAND","That ever-valiant and approved Scot,"
"58","Henry IV","4","1.1.55","WESTMORELAND","At Holmedon met,"
"59","Henry IV","4","1.1.56","WESTMORELAND","Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,"
"60","Henry IV","4","1.1.57","WESTMORELAND","As by discharge of their artillery,"
"61","Henry IV","4","1.1.58","WESTMORELAND","And shape of likelihood, the news was told,"
"62","Henry IV","4","1.1.59","WESTMORELAND","For he that brought them, in the very heat"
"63","Henry IV","4","1.1.60","WESTMORELAND","And pride of their contention did take horse,"
"64","Henry IV","4","1.1.61","WESTMORELAND","Uncertain of the issue any way."
"65","Henry IV","5","1.1.62","KING HENRY IV","Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,"
"66","Henry IV","5","1.1.63","KING HENRY IV","Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse."
"67","Henry IV","5","1.1.64","KING HENRY IV","Stain'd with the variation of each soil"
"68","Henry IV","5","1.1.65","KING HENRY IV","Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours,"
"69","Henry IV","5","1.1.66","KING HENRY IV","And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news."
"70","Henry IV","5","1.1.67","KING HENRY IV","The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:"
"71","Henry IV","5","1.1.68","KING HENRY IV","Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,"
"72","Henry IV","5","1.1.69","KING HENRY IV","Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see"
"73","Henry IV","5","1.1.70","KING HENRY IV","On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took"
"74","Henry IV","5","1.1.71","KING HENRY IV","Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son"
"75","Henry IV","5","1.1.72","KING HENRY IV","To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Athol,"
"76","Henry IV","5","1.1.73","KING HENRY IV","Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:"
"77","Henry IV","5","1.1.74","KING HENRY IV","And is not this an honourable spoil?"
"78","Henry IV","5","1.1.75","KING HENRY IV","A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?"
"79","Henry IV","6","1.1.76","WESTMORELAND","In faith,"
"80","Henry IV","6","1.1.77","WESTMORELAND","It is a conquest for a prince to boast of."
"81","Henry IV","7","1.1.78","KING HENRY IV","Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin"
"82","Henry IV","7","1.1.79","KING HENRY IV","In envy that my Lord Northumberland"
"83","Henry IV","7","1.1.80","KING HENRY IV","Should be the father to so blest a son,"
"84","Henry IV","7","1.1.81","KING HENRY IV","A son who is the theme of honour's tongue,"
"85","Henry IV","7","1.1.82","KING HENRY IV","Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant,"
"86","Henry IV","7","1.1.83","KING HENRY IV","Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:"
"87","Henry IV","7","1.1.84","KING HENRY IV","Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,"
"88","Henry IV","7","1.1.85","KING HENRY IV","See riot and dishonour stain the brow"
"89","Henry IV","7","1.1.86","KING HENRY IV","Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved"
"90","Henry IV","7","1.1.87","KING HENRY IV","That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged"
"91","Henry IV","7","1.1.88","KING HENRY IV","In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,"
"92","Henry IV","7","1.1.89","KING HENRY IV","And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!"
"93","Henry IV","7","1.1.90","KING HENRY IV","Then would I have his Harry, and he mine."
"94","Henry IV","7","1.1.91","KING HENRY IV","But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,"
"95","Henry IV","7","1.1.92","KING HENRY IV","Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,"
"96","Henry IV","7","1.1.93","KING HENRY IV","Which he in this adventure hath surprised,"
"97","Henry IV","7","1.1.94","KING HENRY IV","To his own use he keeps, and sends me word,"
"98","Henry IV","7","1.1.95","KING HENRY IV","I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife."
"99","Henry IV","8","1.1.96","WESTMORELAND","This is his uncle's teaching, this is Worcester,"
"100","Henry IV","8","1.1.97","WESTMORELAND","Malevolent to you in all aspects,"
"101","Henry IV","8","1.1.98","WESTMORELAND","Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up"
"102","Henry IV","8","1.1.99","WESTMORELAND","The crest of youth against your dignity."
"103","Henry IV","9","1.1.100","KING HENRY IV","But I have sent for him to answer this,"
"104","Henry IV","9","1.1.101","KING HENRY IV","And for this cause awhile we must neglect"
"105","Henry IV","9","1.1.102","KING HENRY IV","Our holy purpose to Jerusalem."
"106","Henry IV","9","1.1.103","KING HENRY IV","Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we"
"107","Henry IV","9","1.1.104","KING HENRY IV","Will hold at Windsor, so inform the lords:"
"108","Henry IV","9","1.1.105","KING HENRY IV","But come yourself with speed to us again,"
"109","Henry IV","9","1.1.106","KING HENRY IV","For more is to be said and to be done"
"110","Henry IV","9","1.1.107","KING HENRY IV","Than out of anger can be uttered."
"111","Henry IV","10","1.1.108","WESTMORELAND","I will, my liege."
"112","Henry IV","10",,"WESTMORELAND","Exeunt"
"113","Henry IV","10",,"WESTMORELAND","SCENE II. London. An apartment of the Prince's."
"114","Henry IV","10",,"WESTMORELAND","Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF"
"115","Henry IV","1","1.2.1","FALSTAFF","Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?"
"116","Henry IV","2","1.2.2","PRINCE HENRY","Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack"
"117","Henry IV","2","1.2.3","PRINCE HENRY","and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon"
"118","Henry IV","2","1.2.4","PRINCE HENRY","benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to"
"119","Henry IV","2","1.2.5","PRINCE HENRY","demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know."
"120","Henry IV","2","1.2.6","PRINCE HENRY","What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the"
"121","Henry IV","2","1.2.7","PRINCE HENRY","day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes"
"122","Henry IV","2","1.2.8","PRINCE HENRY","capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the"
"123","Henry IV","2","1.2.9","PRINCE HENRY","signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself"
"124","Henry IV","2","1.2.10","PRINCE HENRY","a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no"
"125","Henry IV","2","1.2.11","PRINCE HENRY","reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand"
"126","Henry IV","2","1.2.12","PRINCE HENRY","the time of the day."
"127","Henry IV","3","1.2.13","FALSTAFF","Indeed, you come near me now, Hal, for we that take"
"128","Henry IV","3","1.2.14","FALSTAFF","purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not"
"129","Henry IV","3","1.2.15","FALSTAFF","by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,"
"130","Henry IV","3","1.2.16","FALSTAFF","I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God"
"131","Henry IV","3","1.2.17","FALSTAFF","save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace"
"132","Henry IV","3","1.2.18","FALSTAFF","thou wilt have none,--"
"133","Henry IV","4","1.2.19","PRINCE HENRY","What, none?"
"134","Henry IV","5","1.2.20","FALSTAFF","No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to"
"135","Henry IV","5","1.2.21","FALSTAFF","prologue to an egg and butter."
"136","Henry IV","6","1.2.22","PRINCE HENRY","Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly."
"137","Henry IV","7","1.2.23","FALSTAFF","Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not"
"138","Henry IV","7","1.2.24","FALSTAFF","us that are squires of the night's body be called"
"139","Henry IV","7","1.2.25","FALSTAFF","thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's"
"140","Henry IV","7","1.2.26","FALSTAFF","foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the"
"141","Henry IV","7","1.2.27","FALSTAFF","moon, and let men say we be men of good government,"
"142","Henry IV","7","1.2.28","FALSTAFF","being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and"
"143","Henry IV","7","1.2.29","FALSTAFF","chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal."
"144","Henry IV","8","1.2.30","PRINCE HENRY","Thou sayest well, and it holds well too, for the"
"145","Henry IV","8","1.2.31","PRINCE HENRY","fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and"
"146","Henry IV","8","1.2.32","PRINCE HENRY","flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,"
"147","Henry IV","8","1.2.33","PRINCE HENRY","by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold"
"148","Henry IV","8","1.2.34","PRINCE HENRY","most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most"
"149","Henry IV","8","1.2.35","PRINCE HENRY","dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning, got with"
"150","Henry IV","8","1.2.36","PRINCE HENRY","swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in,'"
"151","Henry IV","8","1.2.37","PRINCE HENRY","now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder"
"152","Henry IV","8","1.2.38","PRINCE HENRY","and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows."
"153","Henry IV","9","1.2.39","FALSTAFF","By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my"
"154","Henry IV","9","1.2.40","FALSTAFF","hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?"
"155","Henry IV","10","1.2.41","PRINCE HENRY","As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And"
"156","Henry IV","10","1.2.42","PRINCE HENRY","is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?"
"157","Henry IV","11","1.2.43","FALSTAFF","How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and"
"158","Henry IV","11","1.2.44","FALSTAFF","thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a"
"159","Henry IV","11","1.2.45","FALSTAFF","buff jerkin?"
"160","Henry IV","12","1.2.46","PRINCE HENRY","Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?"
"161","Henry IV","13","1.2.47","FALSTAFF","Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a"
"162","Henry IV","13","1.2.48","FALSTAFF","time and oft."
"163","Henry IV","14","1.2.49","PRINCE HENRY","Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?"
"164","Henry IV","15","1.2.50","FALSTAFF","No, I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there."
"165","Henry IV","16","1.2.51","PRINCE HENRY","Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch,"
"166","Henry IV","16","1.2.52","PRINCE HENRY","and where it would not, I have used my credit."
"167","Henry IV","17","1.2.53","FALSTAFF","Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent"
"168","Henry IV","17","1.2.54","FALSTAFF","that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet"
"169","Henry IV","17","1.2.55","FALSTAFF","wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when"
"170","Henry IV","17","1.2.56","FALSTAFF","thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is"
"171","Henry IV","17","1.2.57","FALSTAFF","with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do"
"172","Henry IV","17","1.2.58","FALSTAFF","not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief."
"173","Henry IV","18","1.2.59","PRINCE HENRY","No, thou shalt."
"174","Henry IV","19","1.2.60","FALSTAFF","Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge."
"175","Henry IV","20","1.2.61","PRINCE HENRY","Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have"
"176","Henry IV","20","1.2.62","PRINCE HENRY","the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman."
"177","Henry IV","21","1.2.63","FALSTAFF","Well, Hal, well, and in some sort it jumps with my"
"178","Henry IV","21","1.2.64","FALSTAFF","humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell"
"179","Henry IV","21","1.2.65","FALSTAFF","you."
"180","Henry IV","22","1.2.66","PRINCE HENRY","For obtaining of suits?"
"181","Henry IV","23","1.2.67","FALSTAFF","Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman"
"182","Henry IV","23","1.2.68","FALSTAFF","hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy"
"183","Henry IV","23","1.2.69","FALSTAFF","as a gib cat or a lugged bear."
"184","Henry IV","24","1.2.70","PRINCE HENRY","Or an old lion, or a lover's lute."
"185","Henry IV","25","1.2.71","FALSTAFF","Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe."
"186","Henry IV","26","1.2.72","PRINCE HENRY","What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of"
"187","Henry IV","26","1.2.73","PRINCE HENRY","Moor-ditch?"
"188","Henry IV","27","1.2.74","FALSTAFF","Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed"
"189","Henry IV","27","1.2.75","FALSTAFF","the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young"
"190","Henry IV","27","1.2.76","FALSTAFF","prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more"
"191","Henry IV","27","1.2.77","FALSTAFF","with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a"
"192","Henry IV","27","1.2.78","FALSTAFF","commodity of good names were to be bought. An old"
"193","Henry IV","27","1.2.79","FALSTAFF","lord of the council rated me the other day in the"
"194","Henry IV","27","1.2.80","FALSTAFF","street about you, sir, but I marked him not, and yet"
"195","Henry IV","27","1.2.81","FALSTAFF","he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not, and"
"196","Henry IV","27","1.2.82","FALSTAFF","yet he talked wisely, and in the street too."
"197","Henry IV","28","1.2.83","PRINCE HENRY","Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out in the"
"198","Henry IV","28","1.2.84","PRINCE HENRY","streets, and no man regards it."
"199","Henry IV","29","1.2.85","FALSTAFF","O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able"
"200","Henry IV","29","1.2.86","FALSTAFF","to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon"
"201","Henry IV","29","1.2.87","FALSTAFF","me, Hal, God forgive thee for it! Before I knew"
"202","Henry IV","29","1.2.88","FALSTAFF","thee, Hal, I knew nothing, and now am I, if a man"
"203","Henry IV","29","1.2.89","FALSTAFF","should speak truly, little better than one of the"
"204","Henry IV","29","1.2.90","FALSTAFF","wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give"
"205","Henry IV","29","1.2.91","FALSTAFF","it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:"
"206","Henry IV","29","1.2.92","FALSTAFF","I'll be damned for never a king's son in"
"207","Henry IV","29","1.2.93","FALSTAFF","Christendom."
"208","Henry IV","30","1.2.94","PRINCE HENRY","Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?"
"209","Henry IV","31","1.2.95","FALSTAFF","'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad, I'll make one, an I"
"210","Henry IV","31","1.2.96","FALSTAFF","do not, call me villain and baffle me."
"211","Henry IV","32","1.2.97","PRINCE HENRY","I see a good amendment of life in thee, from praying"
"212","Henry IV","32","1.2.98","PRINCE HENRY","to purse-taking."
"213","Henry IV","33","1.2.99","FALSTAFF","Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal, 'tis no sin for a"
"214","Henry IV","33","1.2.100","FALSTAFF","man to labour in his vocation."
"215","Henry IV","33",,"FALSTAFF","Enter POINS"
"216","Henry IV","33","1.2.101","FALSTAFF","Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a"
"217","Henry IV","33","1.2.102","FALSTAFF","match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what"
"218","Henry IV","33","1.2.103","FALSTAFF","hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the"
"219","Henry IV","33","1.2.104","FALSTAFF","most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to"
"220","Henry IV","33","1.2.105","FALSTAFF","a true man."
"221","Henry IV","34","1.2.106","PRINCE HENRY","Good morrow, Ned."
"222","Henry IV","35","1.2.107","POINS","Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?"
"223","Henry IV","35","1.2.108","POINS","what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how"
"224","Henry IV","35","1.2.109","POINS","agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou"
"225","Henry IV","35","1.2.110","POINS","soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira"
"226","Henry IV","35","1.2.111","POINS","and a cold capon's leg?"
"227","Henry IV","36","1.2.112","PRINCE HENRY","Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have"
"228","Henry IV","36","1.2.113","PRINCE HENRY","his bargain, for he was never yet a breaker of"
"229","Henry IV","36","1.2.114","PRINCE HENRY","proverbs: he will give the devil his due."
"230","Henry IV","37","1.2.115","POINS","Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil."
"231","Henry IV","38","1.2.116","PRINCE HENRY","Else he had been damned for cozening the devil."
"232","Henry IV","39","1.2.117","POINS","But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four"
"233","Henry IV","39","1.2.118","POINS","o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going"
"234","Henry IV","39","1.2.119","POINS","to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders"
"235","Henry IV","39","1.2.120","POINS","riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards"
"236","Henry IV","39","1.2.121","POINS","for you all, you have horses for yourselves:"
"237","Henry IV","39","1.2.122","POINS","Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke"
"238","Henry IV","39","1.2.123","POINS","supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it"
"239","Henry IV","39","1.2.124","POINS","as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff"
"240","Henry IV","39","1.2.125","POINS","your purses full of crowns, if you will not, tarry"
"241","Henry IV","39","1.2.126","POINS","at home and be hanged."
"242","Henry IV","40","1.2.127","FALSTAFF","Hear ye, Yedward, if I tarry at home and go not,"

"244","Henry IV","41","1.2.129","POINS","You will, chops?"
"245","Henry IV","42","1.2.130","FALSTAFF","Hal, wilt thou make one?"
"246","Henry IV","43","1.2.131","PRINCE HENRY","Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith."
"247","Henry IV","44","1.2.132","FALSTAFF","There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good"
"248","Henry IV","44","1.2.133","FALSTAFF","fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood"
"249","Henry IV","44","1.2.134","FALSTAFF","royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings."
"250","Henry IV","45","1.2.135","PRINCE HENRY","Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap."
"251","Henry IV","46","1.2.136","FALSTAFF","Why, that's well said."
"252","Henry IV","47","1.2.137","PRINCE HENRY","Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home."
"253","Henry IV","48","1.2.138","FALSTAFF","By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king."
"254","Henry IV","49","1.2.139","PRINCE HENRY","I care not."
"255","Henry IV","50","1.2.140","POINS","Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:"
"256","Henry IV","50","1.2.141","POINS","I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure"
"257","Henry IV","50","1.2.142","POINS","that he shall go."
"258","Henry IV","51","1.2.143","FALSTAFF","Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him"
"259","Henry IV","51","1.2.144","FALSTAFF","the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may"
"260","Henry IV","51","1.2.145","FALSTAFF","move and what he hears may be believed, that the"
"261","Henry IV","51","1.2.146","FALSTAFF","true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false"
"262","Henry IV","51","1.2.147","FALSTAFF","thief, for the poor abuses of the time want"
"263","Henry IV","51","1.2.148","FALSTAFF","countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap."
"264","Henry IV","52","1.2.149","PRINCE HENRY","Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!"
"265","Henry IV","52",,"PRINCE HENRY","Exit Falstaff"
"266","Henry IV","53","1.2.150","POINS","Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us"
"267","Henry IV","53","1.2.151","POINS","to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot"
"268","Henry IV","53","1.2.152","POINS","manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill"
"269","Henry IV","53","1.2.153","POINS","shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:"
"270","Henry IV","53","1.2.154","POINS","yourself and I will not be there, and when they"
"271","Henry IV","53","1.2.155","POINS","have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut"
"272","Henry IV","53","1.2.156","POINS","this head off from my shoulders."
"273","Henry IV","54","1.2.157","PRINCE HENRY","How shall we part with them in setting forth?"
"274","Henry IV","55","1.2.158","POINS","Why, we will set forth before or after them, and"
"275","Henry IV","55","1.2.159","POINS","appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at"
"276","Henry IV","55","1.2.160","POINS","our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure"
"277","Henry IV","55","1.2.161","POINS","upon the exploit themselves, which they shall have"
"278","Henry IV","55","1.2.162","POINS","no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them."
"279","Henry IV","56","1.2.163","PRINCE HENRY","Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our"
"280","Henry IV","56","1.2.164","PRINCE HENRY","horses, by our habits and by every other"
"281","Henry IV","56","1.2.165","PRINCE HENRY","appointment, to be ourselves."
"282","Henry IV","57","1.2.166","POINS","Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them"
"283","Henry IV","57","1.2.167","POINS","in the wood, our vizards we will change after we"
"284","Henry IV","57","1.2.168","POINS","leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram"
"285","Henry IV","57","1.2.169","POINS","for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments."
"286","Henry IV","58","1.2.170","PRINCE HENRY","Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us."
"287","Henry IV","59","1.2.171","POINS","Well, for two of them, I know them to be as"
"288","Henry IV","59","1.2.172","POINS","true-bred cowards as ever turned back, and for the"
"289","Henry IV","59","1.2.173","POINS","third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll"
"290","Henry IV","59","1.2.174","POINS","forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the"
"291","Henry IV","59","1.2.175","POINS","incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will"
"292","Henry IV","59","1.2.176","POINS","tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at"
"293","Henry IV","59","1.2.177","POINS","least, he fought with, what wards, what blows, what"
"294","Henry IV","59","1.2.178","POINS","extremities he endured, and in the reproof of this"
"295","Henry IV","59","1.2.179","POINS","lies the jest."
"296","Henry IV","60","1.2.180","PRINCE HENRY","Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things"
"297","Henry IV","60","1.2.181","PRINCE HENRY","necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap,"
"298","Henry IV","60","1.2.182","PRINCE HENRY","there I'll sup. Farewell."
"299","Henry IV","61","1.2.183","POINS","Farewell, my lord."
"300","Henry IV","61",,"POINS","Exit Poins"
"301","Henry IV","62","1.2.184","PRINCE HENRY","I know you all, and will awhile uphold"
"302","Henry IV","62","1.2.185","PRINCE HENRY","The unyoked humour of your idleness:"
"303","Henry IV","62","1.2.186","PRINCE HENRY","Yet herein will I imitate the sun,"
"304","Henry IV","62","1.2.187","PRINCE HENRY","Who doth permit the base contagious clouds"
"305","Henry IV","62","1.2.188","PRINCE HENRY","To smother up his beauty from the world,"
"306","Henry IV","62","1.2.189","PRINCE HENRY","That, when he please again to be himself,"
"307","Henry IV","62","1.2.190","PRINCE HENRY","Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,"
"308","Henry IV","62","1.2.191","PRINCE HENRY","By breaking through the foul and ugly mists"
"309","Henry IV","62","1.2.192","PRINCE HENRY","Of vapours that did seem to strangle him."
"310","Henry IV","62","1.2.193","PRINCE HENRY","If all the year were playing holidays,"
"311","Henry IV","62","1.2.194","PRINCE HENRY","To sport would be as tedious as to work,"
"312","Henry IV","62","1.2.195","PRINCE HENRY","But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,"
"313","Henry IV","62","1.2.196","PRINCE HENRY","And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents."
"314","Henry IV","62","1.2.197","PRINCE HENRY","So, when this loose behavior I throw off"
"315","Henry IV","62","1.2.198","PRINCE HENRY","And pay the debt I never promised,"
"316","Henry IV","62","1.2.199","PRINCE HENRY","By how much better than my word I am,"
"317","Henry IV","62","1.2.200","PRINCE HENRY","By so much shall I falsify men's hopes,"
"318","Henry IV","62","1.2.201","PRINCE HENRY","And like bright metal on a sullen ground,"
"319","Henry IV","62","1.2.202","PRINCE HENRY","My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,"
"320","Henry IV","62","1.2.203","PRINCE HENRY","Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes"
"321","Henry IV","62","1.2.204","PRINCE HENRY","Than that which hath no foil to set it off."
"322","Henry IV","62","1.2.205","PRINCE HENRY","I'll so offend, to make offence a skill,"

"329","Henry IV","1","1.3.3","KING HENRY IV","And you have found me, for accordingly"
"330","Henry IV","1","1.3.4","KING HENRY IV","You tread upon my patience: but be sure"
"331","Henry IV","1","1.3.5","KING HENRY IV","I will from henceforth rather be myself,"
"332","Henry IV","1","1.3.6","KING HENRY IV","Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition,"
"333","Henry IV","1","1.3.7","KING HENRY IV","Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,"
"334","Henry IV","1","1.3.8","KING HENRY IV","And therefore lost that title of respect"
"335","Henry IV","1","1.3.9","KING HENRY IV","Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud."
"336","Henry IV","2","1.3.10","EARL OF WORCESTER","Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves"

"341","Henry IV","4","1.3.15","KING HENRY IV","Worcester, get thee gone, for I do see"
"342","Henry IV","4","1.3.16","KING HENRY IV","Danger and disobedience in thine eye:"
"343","Henry IV","4","1.3.17","KING HENRY IV","O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,"
"344","Henry IV","4","1.3.18","KING HENRY IV","And majesty might never yet endure"
"345","Henry IV","4","1.3.19","KING HENRY IV","The moody frontier of a servant brow."

"348","Henry IV","4",,"KING HENRY IV","Exit Worcester"
"349","Henry IV","4","1.3.22","KING HENRY IV","You were about to speak."
"350","Henry IV","4",,"KING HENRY IV","To North"
"351","Henry IV","5","1.3.23","NORTHUMBERLAND","Yea, my good lord."
"352","Henry IV","5","1.3.24","NORTHUMBERLAND","Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,"
"353","Henry IV","5","1.3.25","NORTHUMBERLAND","Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,"
"354","Henry IV","5","1.3.26","NORTHUMBERLAND","Were, as he says, not with such strength denied"

"358","Henry IV","6","1.3.30","HOTSPUR","My liege, I did deny no prisoners."
"359","Henry IV","6","1.3.31","HOTSPUR","But I remember, when the fight was done,"
"360","Henry IV","6","1.3.32","HOTSPUR","When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,"
"361","Henry IV","6","1.3.33","HOTSPUR","Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,"
"362","Henry IV","6","1.3.34","HOTSPUR","Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,"
"363","Henry IV","6","1.3.35","HOTSPUR","Fresh as a bridegroom, and his chin new reap'd"
"364","Henry IV","6","1.3.36","HOTSPUR","Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home,"
"365","Henry IV","6","1.3.37","HOTSPUR","He was perfumed like a milliner,"
"366","Henry IV","6","1.3.38","HOTSPUR","And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held"
"367","Henry IV","6","1.3.39","HOTSPUR","A pouncet-box, which ever and anon"
"368","Henry IV","6","1.3.40","HOTSPUR","He gave his nose and took't away again,"
"369","Henry IV","6","1.3.41","HOTSPUR","Who therewith angry, when it next came there,"
"370","Henry IV","6","1.3.42","HOTSPUR","Took it in snuff, and still he smiled and talk'd,"
"371","Henry IV","6","1.3.43","HOTSPUR","And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,"
"372","Henry IV","6","1.3.44","HOTSPUR","He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,"
"373","Henry IV","6","1.3.45","HOTSPUR","To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse"
"374","Henry IV","6","1.3.46","HOTSPUR","Betwixt the wind and his nobility."
"375","Henry IV","6","1.3.47","HOTSPUR","With many holiday and lady terms"
"376","Henry IV","6","1.3.48","HOTSPUR","He question'd me, amongst the rest, demanded"
"377","Henry IV","6","1.3.49","HOTSPUR","My prisoners in your majesty's behalf."
"378","Henry IV","6","1.3.50","HOTSPUR","I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,"
"379","Henry IV","6","1.3.51","HOTSPUR","To be so pester'd with a popinjay,"
"380","Henry IV","6","1.3.52","HOTSPUR","Out of my grief and my impatience,"
"381","Henry IV","6","1.3.53","HOTSPUR","Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,"
"382","Henry IV","6","1.3.54","HOTSPUR","He should or he should not, for he made me mad"
"383","Henry IV","6","1.3.55","HOTSPUR","To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet"
"384","Henry IV","6","1.3.56","HOTSPUR","And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman"
"385","Henry IV","6","1.3.57","HOTSPUR","Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--"
"386","Henry IV","6","1.3.58","HOTSPUR","And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth"
"387","Henry IV","6","1.3.59","HOTSPUR","Was parmaceti for an inward bruise,"
"388","Henry IV","6","1.3.60","HOTSPUR","And that it was great pity, so it was,"
"389","Henry IV","6","1.3.61","HOTSPUR","This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd"
"390","Henry IV","6","1.3.62","HOTSPUR","Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,"
"391","Henry IV","6","1.3.63","HOTSPUR","Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd"

"394","Henry IV","6","1.3.66","HOTSPUR","This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,"
"395","Henry IV","6","1.3.67","HOTSPUR","I answer'd indirectly, as I said,"
"396","Henry IV","6","1.3.68","HOTSPUR","And I beseech you, let not his report"
"397","Henry IV","6","1.3.69","HOTSPUR","Come current for an accusation"

"405","Henry IV","7","1.3.77","SIR WALTER BLUNT","What then he said, so he unsay it now."
"406","Henry IV","8","1.3.78","KING HENRY IV","Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,"
"407","Henry IV","8","1.3.79","KING HENRY IV","But with proviso and exception,"
"408","Henry IV","8","1.3.80","KING HENRY IV","That we at our own charge shall ransom straight"
"409","Henry IV","8","1.3.81","KING HENRY IV","His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer,"

"422","Henry IV","9","1.3.94","HOTSPUR","Revolted Mortimer!"
"423","Henry IV","9","1.3.95","HOTSPUR","He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,"

"433","Henry IV","9","1.3.105","HOTSPUR","Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood,"
"434","Henry IV","9","1.3.106","HOTSPUR","Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,"
"435","Henry IV","9","1.3.107","HOTSPUR","Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,"
"436","Henry IV","9","1.3.108","HOTSPUR","And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,"
"437","Henry IV","9","1.3.109","HOTSPUR","Bloodstained with these valiant combatants."
"438","Henry IV","9","1.3.110","HOTSPUR","Never did base and rotten policy"
"439","Henry IV","9","1.3.111","HOTSPUR","Colour her working with such deadly wounds,"
"440","Henry IV","9","1.3.112","HOTSPUR","Nor could the noble Mortimer"
"441","Henry IV","9","1.3.113","HOTSPUR","Receive so many, and all willingly:"

"443","Henry IV","10","1.3.115","KING HENRY IV","Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him,"
"444","Henry IV","10","1.3.116","KING HENRY IV","He never did encounter with Glendower:"
"445","Henry IV","10","1.3.117","KING HENRY IV","I tell thee,"
"446","Henry IV","10","1.3.118","KING HENRY IV","He durst as well have met the devil alone"
"447","Henry IV","10","1.3.119","KING HENRY IV","As Owen Glendower for an enemy."
"448","Henry IV","10","1.3.120","KING HENRY IV","Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth"
"449","Henry IV","10","1.3.121","KING HENRY IV","Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:"

"466","Henry IV","13","1.3.136","HOTSPUR","Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,"
"467","Henry IV","13","1.3.137","HOTSPUR","And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,"
"468","Henry IV","13","1.3.138","HOTSPUR","But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer"
"469","Henry IV","13","1.3.139","HOTSPUR","As high in the air as this unthankful king,"
"470","Henry IV","13","1.3.140","HOTSPUR","As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke."

"475","Henry IV","16","1.3.145","HOTSPUR","Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,"
"476","Henry IV","16","1.3.146","HOTSPUR","And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,"
"477","Henry IV","16","1.3.147","HOTSPUR","Trembling even at the name of Mortimer."

"559","Henry IV","32","1.3.229","HOTSPUR","Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer,"

"582","Henry IV","37","1.3.252","HOTSPUR","A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire,"
"583","Henry IV","37","1.3.253","HOTSPUR","'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,"

"761","Henry IV","7","2.2.13","FALSTAFF","not but to die a fair death for all this, if I"

"767","Henry IV","7","2.2.19","FALSTAFF","could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!"

"813","Henry IV","26","2.2.63","FALSTAFF","Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather,"
"814","Henry IV","26","2.2.64","FALSTAFF","but yet no coward, Hal."
"815","Henry IV","27","2.2.65","PRINCE HENRY","Well, we leave that to the proof."

"908","Henry IV","2","2.3.44","LADY PERCY","And start so often when thou sit'st alone?"
"909","Henry IV","2","2.3.45","LADY PERCY","Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks,"
"910","Henry IV","2","2.3.46","LADY PERCY","And given my treasures and my rights of thee"

"924","Henry IV","2","2.3.60","LADY PERCY","Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream,"
"925","Henry IV","2","2.3.61","LADY PERCY","And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,"

"953","Henry IV","15","2.3.87","HOTSPUR","So far afoot, I shall be weary, love."
"954","Henry IV","16","2.3.88","LADY PERCY","Come, come, you paraquito, answer me"
"955","Henry IV","16","2.3.89","LADY PERCY","Directly unto this question that I ask:"

"958","Henry IV","17","2.3.92","HOTSPUR","Away,"
"959","Henry IV","17","2.3.93","HOTSPUR","Away, you trifler! Love! I love thee not,"
"960","Henry IV","17","2.3.94","HOTSPUR","I care not for thee, Kate: this is no world"
"961","Henry IV","17","2.3.95","HOTSPUR","To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:"
"962","Henry IV","17","2.3.96","HOTSPUR","We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns,"
"963","Henry IV","17","2.3.97","HOTSPUR","And pass them current too. God's me, my horse!"
"964","Henry IV","17","2.3.98","HOTSPUR","What say'st thou, Kate? what would'st thou"
"965","Henry IV","17","2.3.99","HOTSPUR","have with me?"
"966","Henry IV","18","2.3.100","LADY PERCY","Do you not love me? do you not, indeed?"
"967","Henry IV","18","2.3.101","LADY PERCY","Well, do not then, for since you love me not,"
"968","Henry IV","18","2.3.102","LADY PERCY","I will not love myself. Do you not love me?"
"969","Henry IV","18","2.3.103","LADY PERCY","Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no."
"970","Henry IV","19","2.3.104","HOTSPUR","Come, wilt thou see me ride?"
"971","Henry IV","19","2.3.105","HOTSPUR","And when I am on horseback, I will swear"
"972","Henry IV","19","2.3.106","HOTSPUR","I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate,"
"973","Henry IV","19","2.3.107","HOTSPUR","I must not have you henceforth question me"
"974","Henry IV","19","2.3.108","HOTSPUR","Whither I go, nor reason whereabout:"
"975","Henry IV","19","2.3.109","HOTSPUR","Whither I must, I must, and, to conclude,"
"976","Henry IV","19","2.3.110","HOTSPUR","This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate."
"977","Henry IV","19","2.3.111","HOTSPUR","I know you wise, but yet no farther wise"

"979","Henry IV","19","2.3.113","HOTSPUR","But yet a woman: and for secrecy,"
"980","Henry IV","19","2.3.114","HOTSPUR","No lady closer, for I well believe"
"981","Henry IV","19","2.3.115","HOTSPUR","Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know,"
"982","Henry IV","19","2.3.116","HOTSPUR","And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate."
"983","Henry IV","20","2.3.117","LADY PERCY","How! so far?"
"984","Henry IV","21","2.3.118","HOTSPUR","Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate:"
"985","Henry IV","21","2.3.119","HOTSPUR","Whither I go, thither shall you go too,"
"986","Henry IV","21","2.3.120","HOTSPUR","To-day will I set forth, to-morrow you."
"987","Henry IV","21","2.3.121","HOTSPUR","Will this content you, Kate?"
"988","Henry IV","22","2.3.122","LADY PERCY","It must of force."
